# Hello World

I've been heavy on theory and light on practice for most of my time learning data science topics. And, thanks to Luke at BitBootcamp, who convinced me that machine learning is something else I should tackle as well, I have made a point of getting some practice in dealing with that area too. I’m grateful for that nudge… it showed me that I was initially wrong about machine learning. 
 
Getting more hands-on with everything has created a challenge for me, and I've decided to practice practice practice as a way to work through the challenge of understanding things better. 
 
 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	This struggle has a home - this repo is where lives.
 
For getting practice in, I have been piecing together projects that force me to practice working **A LOT** with Python (which is fine, because I prefer it to R) and getting more and more practice with handling data, thinking through problems, and putting tools to work as well.
 
Also, this prep work is forcing me to revisit statistics, data analysis, and ... the most challenging part ... machine learning (which was almost completely foreign to me prior to starting these projects, because I had only taken one course in it prior).
 
<br/>
The components and inspiration are being pieced together from places such as:

* Kaggle
* Udacity
* Coursera
* Udemy
* Public datasets (like stuff made available by the U.S.’ [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov)
* Books like Wes McKinney’s Python for Data Analysis, James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani’s Intro to Statistical Learning, Peter Harrington’s Machine Learning in Action

<br/>
It’s a journey… still. As such, I will keep adding to this repo over time.
